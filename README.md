Tunnelingly was estabished in May 2019, user-interpreted application for data plotting including rock types, Rock Mass Rating (RMR),
grout consumption, overburden, and grouting pressure in tunnel construction.

For a full web application, you can visit <a href="http://www.tunnelingly.com/" target="_blank">Tunnelingly</a>. On the website, you don't need to run any code to build the tunnel model. Just download .xlsx file then save it into .csv file, upload .csv file to the website. The website will generate a model itself.

I used to work as a Site Engineer for water-diversion tunnel construction at Chiang Mai, Thailand with Unique Engineering and Construction PLC in 2017

Tracking the grout pressure around the tunnel is needed by plot the pressure number on the 2D horizon table. Unfortunately, It's not working great enough to interpret the pressure pattern to relate to rock types, Rock Mass Rating (RMR), grout consumption, overburden, and grouting pressure. 

So I tried to find a solution which can be solved for this problem. Python with Plotly module, it's would be great to work on this problem. I am happy to answer every question if you have any questions on the Tunnelignly code or application. Also, I appreciate everyone who needs to develop this code to work better in any way. I open this code to the public for everyone in this world.

I appreciate everyone who supports this project. Unique Engineering and Construction PLC, this project was followed the construction path of the water-division tunnel construction project which contractors by them. They give me a lot of ideas which help me to code this project. Kittikhun Soonthornwong, he is my supervisor during I worked in a project. He gave me a great idea to use Python to solve this problem. Finally, this project cannot be done if Tadsuda Taksavasu, my wife doesn't help me with the programming structure.

Best Regards,
